# Rock, Paper and Scissors Using AI

I have created this project using Hands Keypoints detection using Deep Learning model. Basically working of this model is that you have to select your sign like scissors, rock or paper. Until the counter become equal to 50 and that time a computer picks random sign and then makes predictions about whether AI wins or Computer wins.
